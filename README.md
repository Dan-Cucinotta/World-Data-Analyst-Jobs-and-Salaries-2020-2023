        Data analyst salaries and available jobs globally/Nationally 2020-2023 was examined for trends,
anomalies, and beneficial insight. A visual presentation was developed as well as a comprehensive report. 

        The complete project consists of several elements: #1) Procured, cleaned, and merged 5 datasets 
into a single dataframe using Python with Pandas in a Jupyter Notebook file. #2) Analyzed for trends/anomalies 
and calculated z-scores with the library (SciPy) function (stats.zscore) as well as created a comma separated 
values (.csv) file for importing the data into Tableau. #3) A visually illustrated story was composed in Tableau, 
which consists of 9 descriptive analysis models and 1 supervised classification/logistic regression model that 
is presented in a series of dashboards, in which many are animated with alternantin pages. #4) A conclusive
33-page report was composed to elaborate upon the data and findings of the global/National statistics (macro: global, 
meso: U.S. Nationally, micro: States) apropos various combinations of specific attributes (location/remote, 
company size, experience level, salary, etc.) to showcase/highlight remarkable values and/or significance.
#5) A powerpoint presentation was created to display all of the visualizations streamilned (alternating 
pages/animations).
